## Welcome. 

Hello, and welcome to my site. Here, you will find some unorganized thoughts as well as some coding snippets, or chunks, as I find something interesting or useful.

## Background

My undergraduate degree was in Biology, and I was always interested in learning about how the _structure_ of things translated to _function_. So, in many ways, my interest in coding and programming evolved quite naturally from this phylogenetic desire to classify and understand the organisms that populate our world. To that end, I started with a few introductory computer science courses and then joined the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) as a graduate student in [Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics). I received my PhD based on my thesis work in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data in the lab of [Dr. Ryan Mills](http://millslab.org).

## Programming
Although I started my training in programming by learning C++ and JavaScript, my language of choice is [Python](https://www.python.org). I am also quite comfortable with [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), as I find many of the plotting features of R more intuitive. That is changing, as I find that I am using [plotly](https://plot.ly/) more; its support for [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/) is quite a nice feature for those similarly versed in both Python and R, like myself. In fact, going back and forth between Python and R was, in part, a motivating factor for starting this site.

## Organization
I have structured this site as follows:

#### Posts
* These will consist of, more often than not, more random thoughts or superficial snippets of code.

#### Chunks
* Will follow a more structured theme that looks, a little bit more in depth, at a particular problem or feature that I find interesting or useful.

#### Python
* These will be Python-specific posts, presented as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks, on my GitHub repository. I've chosen to host the notebooks in this way because I prefer the ease of posting to this site using Hugo (which supports RMarkdown quite nicely). So expect changes to the formatting of this site as I work to integrate my Python more organically into the site.

#### Resume
* I have come to like keeping version-controlled copies of my resume and academic CV. I am currently looking for opportunities in data science and bioinformatics, so keeping these documents current is an important exercise.

## Thank You
Thank you for visiting! I hope that you will find this site interesting, perhaps helpful, and if nothing else, entertaining as you see me bumble my way throught code. I profess no expertise because I am always finding new, different, and more efficient ways to code or look at data; going back to my biological roots, it's my opinion that if you stop learning, you stop evolving. Thanks again!
